This program Uses Newton's Method to find nth root of a number(base 10)
Use: nth_root(n,nthRoot,precision=20) method
It takes 3 arguments:
1st arg: n: number whose nth root is to be find
2nd arg: nthRoot: This specifies which root you want to find (2 for square root, 3 for cube root, 4 for 4th root, etc)
3rd arg: precision: It specifies digits of precision you want after decimal
