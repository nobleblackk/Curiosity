This program Uses Newton's Method to find nth root of a number(base 10).

Use: nth_root() method

It takes 3 arguments:

1st arg: n: number whose nth root is to be find.

2nd arg: nthRoot: This specifies which root you want to find (2 for square root, 3 for cube root, 4 for 4th root, etc).

3rd arg: precision: It specifies digits of precision you want after decimal.
