GraphUsingHashTable.py takes a csv file that contain the Graphs and with their nodes and edges respectively.
But it's not necessary you can create your own graph explicitly.
GraphUsingHashTable.py works well with directed and undirected.
There is one flag isUndirected if it's True(by default it is True). Then Graph is treated as Undirected, Directed Otherwise.
Example of creating a Graph is in GraphUsingHashTable.py

There are some rules for csv file:
1. The '#' works as a separator to separate Graphs.
2. Just below the '#' cell specify ‘,’ (comma) separated vertices. 
3. Below that cell there is bunch of pair or cells that represents edges.
4. '!' is use as End Of File.

There is a Folder 'DataSet' there are sample csv files.
Load that csv file (or csv file created by you) by load() function.
